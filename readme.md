# Overview

This project is an example of n-body particle rendering with a simple point pipeline rendering. It features:

- A shader computing a "realistic" mass / size ratio, with a radius proportional to the cube root of the mass.
- At the moment, a simple brute force n-body computation simulating gravity.
- Simulation of merging particles: to avoid simulation collapse when two particles are really close (which often cause
both of them to be shoot out really fast), two close particles are merged

# Merging mechanism

At the moment, the merging criteria is a fixed minimum distance between particles. A better approach would be to find a criteria
which takes into account the mass, so that two heavy bodies or one heavy and one small body merge at a further distance than two
small particles.

The implementation is not optimised and quite trivial: the heavier particle is given the sum of the mass and inertia of the two
coming particles, and the smallest one is set a mass of zero, and then ignored in the rest of the simulation. This can become
very sparse after a while, but it avoids changing some buffer and gpu buffer sizes, and the simulation still becomes a bit faster
as null mass particles are skipped.

# Precision about build

The repository already contains libs for windows: the external dependencies are thus not expected to be build. However, they
seems to be given in release mode, so trying to create a Debug build could be problematic.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how you can write your own VR application using OpenXR and Vulkan. These are its main features:

- Basic rendering of example scene to the headset and into a resizeable mirror view on your desktop monitor. 
- Focus on easy to read and understand C++ without smart pointers, inheritance, templates, etc.
- Usage of the Vulkan `multiview` extension for extra performance.
- Warning-free code base spread over a small handful of classes.
- No OpenXR or Vulkan validation errors or warnings.
- CMake project setup for easy building.

Integrating both OpenXR and Vulkan yourself can be a daunting and painfully time-consuming task. Both APIs are very verbose and require the correct handling of countless minute details. This is why there are two main use cases where this project comes in handy:

1. Fork the repository and use it as a starting point to save yourself weeks of tedious integration work before you get to the juicy bits of VR development.
2. Reference the code while writing your own implementation from scratch, to help you out if you are stuck with a problem, or simply for inspiration.


## Running the OpenXR Vulkan Example

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/janhsimon/openxr-vulkan-example/releases) (once available) or build the project yourself with the steps below.
2. Make sure your headset is connected to your computer.
3. Run the program!


## Building the OpenXR Vulkan Example

1. Install the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com) version 1.3 or newer.
2. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download) version 3.1 or newer.
3. Clone the repository and generate build files.
4. Build!

The repository includes binaries for all dependencies except the Vulkan SDK on Windows. These can be found in the `external` folder. You will have to build these dependencies yourself on other platforms. Use the adress and version tag or commit hash in `version.txt` to ensure compatibility. Please don't hesitate to open a pull request if you have built dependencies for previously unsupported platforms.
